# Apple-Music-Top-10K-Tracks

This project analyzes a dataset containing 10,000 tracks from Apple Music. The dataset encompasses various music genres and cultural influences, making it suitable for studying music trends, building recommendation systems, and conducting data science analyses. The project follows ethical guidelines and respects copyright laws.

# Project Steps
## 1.Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Imported necessary libraries.
Loaded the dataset and examined its structure.
Identified and handled missing values.

## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's characteristics.
Visualized distributions and relationships between variables.
Explored the most popular artists and songs on Apple Music.
Analyzed price distributions and genre distributions across tracks.

## 3.Machine Learning Modeling:
Trained and evaluated three regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## 4.Feature Importance Analysis:
Examined feature importance in the Random Forest model to understand variables influencing track counts.

## 5.Conclusion:
Concluded that the Random Forest Regressor provides the best predictive performance.
Highlighted the importance of the project's findings in understanding music trends and predicting track popularity on Apple Music.
